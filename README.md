  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

We wanted to create a Prework Study Guide Webpage because we wanted to help bootcamp students on their first steps in web development.
This project was built to teach new students the basics of HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript before their Boot Camp.
One of the problems people face when learning to code is the amount of information and the different tools you have to use which can be scary at first. This guide aims to breakdown for them some of the key components of web development and prepare them for the camp.
With this project I have learnt how to use Git and Github for version control and how to add JavaScript to your code.
